# GC9A01A Display Driver

## Intro 

GC9A01 is a 262,144-color single-chip SOC driver for a-TFT liquid crystal display with resolution of 240RGBx240 dots, comprising a 360-channel source driver, a 32-channel gate driver, 129,600 bytes GRAM for graphic display data of 240RGBx240 dots, and power supply circuit.

It  supports parallel 8-/9-/12-/16-/18-bit data bus MCU interface, 6-/12-/16-/18-bit data bus RGB interface and 3-/4-line serial peripheral interface (SPI). The moving picture area can be specified in internal GRAM by window address function. The specified window area can be updated selectively, so that moving picture can be displayed simultaneously independent of still picture area.

It also supports full color, 8-color display mode and sleep mode for precise power control by software and these features make the GC9A01 an ideal LCD driver for medium or small size portable products such as digital cellular phones, smart phone, MP3 and PMP where long battery life is a major concern.
