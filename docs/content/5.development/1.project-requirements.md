# Project Requirements

- Should work under MicroPython 1.23+, with a minimal footprint.
- Should work with "any" LCD driver in a pluggable manner (e.g., support for the GC9A01A over SPI support only included if needed ). User is able to select which base driver to use.
- Will need to create a common API for talking to different display drivers.
- Should take the best of [Apple's watchOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-watchos), [Google's WearOS](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/wear), and other frameworks such as [DicksonUI](https://dicksonui.gitbook.io/docs/) or [Kivy](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/)
